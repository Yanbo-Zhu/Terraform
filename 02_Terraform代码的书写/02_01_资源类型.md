data
Data blocks in Terraform are used to fetch or compute information for use elsewhere in a Terraform configuration. They allow you to read data from external sources such as an API, a file, or a database and use it to populate variables or other parts of your Terraform configuration.

provider
A provider block is used to configure the provider plugin used in Terraform configuration, it's not related to data fetching or computation

resource
A resource block is used to create and manage infrastructure resources, it's not related to data fetching or computation

local
A local block is used to define variables that are only used within the module in which they are defined and not exposed as outputs. It's not related to data fetching or computation.
It's important to understand that data blocks do not make changes to the infrastructure, they are only used to fetch or compute data.
