terraform plan命令被用来创建变更计划。Terraform会先运行一次refresh(我们后面的章节会介绍，该行为也可以被显式关闭)，然后决定要执行哪些变更使得现有状态迁移到代码描述的期待状态。

该命令可以方便地审查状态迁移的所有细节而不会实际更改现有资源以及状态文件。例如，在将代码提交到版本控制系统前可以先执行terraform plan，确认变更行为如同预期一般。

可选参数-out可以将变更计划保存在一个文件中，以便日后使用terraform apply命令来执行该计划。
如果Terraform检测不到任何变更，那么terraform plan会提示没有任何需要执行的变更。

A "normal" terraform plan includes two main behaviors:
1. Update the state from the previous run to reflect any changes made outside of Terraform. That's called "refreshing" in Terraform terminology.
2. Comparing that updated state with the desired state described by the configuration, and in case of any differences generating a proposed set of actions to change the real remote objects to match the desired state.


## 1.1 用法

terraform plan [options] [dir]

默认情况下，plan命令不需要参数，使用当前工作目录下的代码和状态文件执行refresh。

有如下参数可以使用：

- -compact-warnings：如果Terraform生成了一些告警信息而没有伴随的错误信息，那么以只显示消息总结的精简形式展示告警
- -destroy：生成销毁所有资源的计划. The plan -destroy' command will only show what is going to be destroyed (it's only a plan).
- -detailed-exitcode：当命令退出时返回一个详细的返回码。如果有该参数，那么返回码将会包含更详细的含义：
    - 0 = 成功的空计划(没有变更)
    - 1 = 错误
    - 2 = 成功的非空计划(有变更)
    
- -input=true：在取不到值的情况下是否提示用户给定输入变量值
- -lock=true：与apply类似，不再赘述
- -lock-timeout=0s：与apply类似，不再赘述
- -no-color：关闭彩色输出
- -out=path：将变更计划保存到指定路径下的文件中，随后我们可以使用terraform apply执行该计划
    - To ensure that the execution plan you reviewed with terraform plan is the exact one used by terraform apply, you can save the plan to a file and pass that file to terraform apply. For example: terraform plan -out=my_plan.tfplan, then  terraform apply my_plan.tfplan
- -parallelism-n：限制Terraform遍历图的最大并行度，默认值为10
- -refresh=true：计算变更前先执行refresh
- -state=path：状态文件的位置，默认为"terraform.tfstate"。如果启用了远程Backend则该参数设置无效
- -target=resource：目标资源的地址，该参数可反复声明，用以对基础设施进行部分更新
- -var 'foo=bar'：与apply类似，不再赘述
- -var-file=foo：与apply类似，不再赘述

## 1.2 部分更新

使用-target参数可以使得Terraform专注于一部分的资源。可以使用资源地址来标记这个集合。资源地址按如下规则被解释：

- 如果给定地址能够定位到一个资源，那么只该资源会被标记；如果该资源使用了count参数而没有给定具体访问下标，该资源所有实例都会被标记
- 如果给定地址定位到的不是资源而是一个模块，那么该模块内所有资源及其内嵌模块资源都会被标记

这种标记部分资源并计算更新计划的能力是为了一些比较罕见的场景设计的，例如从先前的错误中恢复或是绕过某些Terraform的设计限制。对于常规操作不推荐使用-target参数，因为它会造成无法检测的配置漂移以及使人无法从代码推导出当前真实的状态。

## 1.3 安全警告

被保存的变更计划文件(使用-out参数)内部可能含有敏感信息，Terraform本身并不会加密计划文件。如果你要移动或是保存该文件一段时间，强烈建议你自行加密该文件。

Terraform未来打算增强计划文件的安全性。

# 2 reference symbol 

- `+` create
- `-` destroy
- `-/+` replace (destroy and then create, or vice-versa if create-before-destroy is used)
- `~` update in-place
- `<=` read

The last one applies only to data resources. You won't see this one often, because whenever possible Terraform does reads during the refresh phase. 
You will see it, though, if you have a data resource whose configuration depends on something that we don't know yet, such as an attribute of a resource that isn't yet created. 
In that case, it's necessary to wait until apply time to find out the final configuration before doing the read.

# 3 注意点 
## 3.1 Does The terraform plan command  update your local state file? 

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66240556/terraform-plan-not-updating-state-file
yes, it  update your local state file : https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/3631

Terraform compares the desired state (defined in your Terraform configuration) with the actual state (as recorded in the state file and observed in the cloud environment).

==Terraform plan and apply operations run an implicit in-memory refresh as part of their functionality, reconciling any drift from your state file suggesting infrastructure changes.==

1 terraform plan  等效于 terraform plan -refresh=true 
默认状态下 , implicitly 下, run terraform plan,   -refresh就是 true , 即使你不加入 -refresh=true 

2 `terraform plan -refresh=false`
As per the latest documentation the plan operation implicitly does refresh unless you specify `-refresh=false`as a parameter.

`terraform plan -refresh=false`: 
`-refresh=false` - Disables the default behavior of synchronizing the Terraform state with remote objects before checking for configuration changes. This can make the planning operation faster by reducing the number of remote API requests. However, setting `-refresh=false` causes Terraform to ignore external changes, which could result in an incomplete or incorrect plan. 


The `terraform plan -refresh=false` command does not update your state file. 
Instead, 
- it does not reads the current state of any already-existing remote objects to make sure that the Terraform state is up-to-date.
- Then, it generates an execution plan by ==comparing the desired state (defined in your Terraform configuration files) with the state (stored in the state file) of your infrastructure, but not comparing with the actual state in thge ==. 

The plan shows the changes that Terraform will make to the infrastructure without actually applying those changes. 

You cannot use`-refresh=false` in `-refresh-only` planning mode because it would effectively disable the entirety of the planning operation.

---

What does running a terraform plan do?
A. Compares your Terraform code and local state file to the remote state file in a cloud provider and determines if any changes need to be made
B. Imports all of your existing cloud provider resources to the state file
C. Installs all providers and modules referenced by configuration
D. Compares the state file to your Terraform code and determines if any changes need to be made

我觉得选A
但是貌似选D

## 3.2 `terraform plan -refresh-only`

Use refresh-only mode to sync Terraform state

Terraform relies on the contents of your workspace's state file to generate an execution plan to make changes to your resources. To ensure the accuracy of the proposed changes, your state file must be up to date.

In Terraform. refreshing your state file Terraform's knowledge of your infrastructure, as represented in your state file, with the actual state of your infrastructure. ==Terraform plan and apply operations run an implicit in-memory refresh as part of their functionality, reconciling any drift from your state file suggesting infrastructure changes.==

==you can update your state file without making modifications to your infrastructure using the -refresh-only flag for terraform plan und terraform apply operation==


https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71327232/what-does-terraform-apply-plan-refresh-only-do
A "normal" terraform plan includes two main behaviors:
1. Update the state from the previous run to reflect any changes made outside of Terraform. That's called "refreshing" in Terraform terminology.
2. Comparing that updated state with the desired state described by the configuration, and in case of any differences generating a proposed set of actions to change the real remote objects to match the desired state.

When you create a "refresh-only" plan, you're disabling the second of those, but still performing the first. Terraform will update the state to match changes made outside of Terraform, and then ask you if you want to commit that result as a new state snapshot to use on future runs. Typically the _desired_ result of a refresh-only plan is for Terraform to report that there were no changes outside of Terraform, although Terraform does allow you to commit the result as a new state snapshot if you wish, for example if the changes cascaded from an updated object used as a `data` resource and you want to save those new results.

A refresh-only plan prevents Terraform from proposing any actions that would change the real infrastructure _for that particular plan_, but it does not avoid the need to deal with any differences in future plans. If the changes that Terraform is proposing are not acceptable then to move forward you will either need to change the configuration to match your actual desired state (for example, to match the current state of the object you don't want to replace) or change the real infrastructure (outside of Terraform) so it will match your configuration.



## 3.3 比较 

**Test Scenario**:
- Created an instance (instanceA) using Terraform resource block.
- Manually deleted instanceA from the console.

**Execution Steps**:--
- Run terraform plan -refresh=false -> No changes expected.
- Run terraform plan -refresh-only -> Note: Objects have changed outside of Terraform, but it will not make any changes in the terraform.tfstate file.
- Run terraform refresh -> Removed instanceA from the terraform.tfstate file.
- Run terraform plan -refresh=false -> Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
- Run terraform plan -refresh-only -> No changes. Your infrastructure still matches the configuration.
