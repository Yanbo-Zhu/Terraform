What does Terraform use .terraform.lock.hcl file for?
A. Tracking provider dependencies
B. There is no such file
C. Preventing Terraform runs from occurring
D. Storing references to workspaces which are locked



A. Tracking provider dependencies
The .terraform.lock.hcl file is used to track provider dependencies and their exact versions. This file is automatically generated by Terraform when you run terraform init. 
It locks the versions of the providers used in your configuration, ensuring that subsequent Terraform runs use the same provider versions for consistency and reproducibility across environments. This file should be committed to your version control system to maintain consistency across team members and environments.

"hcl , and this name is intended to signify that it is a lock file for various items that Terraform caches in the . terraform subdirectory of your working directory. Terraform automatically creates or updates the dependency lock file each time you run the terraform init command."

"Terraform has made some changes to the "provider dependency" selections recorded in the .terraform.lock.hcl file. Review those changes and commit them to your version control system if they represent changes you intended to make."
