A. Versioned infrastructure
C. Idempotence
D. Self-describing infrastructure

A - is a principle (think of the case when you store the state in an S3 bucket and it gets versioned)
C - it is a principle by definition of what terraform does
D - is a principle as you use declarative language -> infrastructure describes itself


----

B. Golden images
B - is NOT a principle (where in terraform documentation is mentioned anything related to images)
B. Golden Images: While golden images (pre-configured images for server deployments) are used in infrastructure management, they are not considered a key principle of laC. lac focuses on defining infrastructure through code that can be versioned, reused, and managed as part of application development workflows. Relying solely on golden images does not fully embrace the dynamism and flexibility offered by lac practices, as it leans more towards a traditional, immutable infrastructure approach.

B. Golden images: While golden images are a common concept in traditional infrastructure management, they are not a key principle of infrastructure as code. lac focuses on defining and managing infrastructure through code rather than relying on pre-configured images.
